# ðŸŽ¤ Mock Interview â€“ Reflection (STAR Technique)

### Situation  
As part of the work readiness portfolio for Project Presentation 3, I conducted a video-recorded mock interview to simulate a real job interview scenario.

### Task  
My goal was to answer common interview questions clearly and professionally, demonstrate effective body language, articulate my skills, and receive feedback on my performance.

### Action  
I prepared by researching typical ICT job interview questions, rehearsed my responses, recorded the session, reviewed the recording for non-verbal cues (posture, eye contact, tone) and noted areas for improvement.

### Result  
The mock interview recording allowed me to identify and improve my presentation style, sharpen my responses, and boost my confidence in a real interview context. I will use this experience to refine my delivery and professional image going forward.
